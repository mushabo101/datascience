      <description>Problem Statement: Predict the probability of a candidate looking for a new job
Essentially, I&amp;rsquo;ll be attempting to predict who is job-seeking and who is not.
Note - The main focus of this notebook is on data visualization so the predictive models can almost certainly be improved upon with some basic tweaks.
Remember though, in industry it is difficult to deploy models that take hours to retrain daily. A good model is often better - and more practical - than a perfect one.</description>

      <description>In this project, I would gladly use this dataset from Capital Bikeshare to analyze and provide enhancement to their business. The bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, an hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. The core data set is related to the two-year historical log corresponding to the years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.</description>

      <description>In the hospitality business, ensuring the availability of hotel rooms at a time and for some time to come is very important in optimizing revenue. Information regarding accurate and actual room availability can prevent the hotel from various losses, such as losses caused by guests who cancel orders or do not check in on their arrival. Guests who cancel their stay, either after notifying the hotel in advance (eg contacting themselves or being contacted by the hotel) or not, cause vacancies in the rooms they should be staying in.</description>

      <description>Nowdays we no longer difficult to know what people think about a topic which is trends, we can analysing the tweets on twitter.
The tweets have a sentiment, positive or negative sentiment use cases for NLP (Natural Language Processing).
In this porject I am going to use NLP with &amp;ldquo;Tweepy&amp;rdquo; library in Python to access our Twitteer API, to start you have to register a twitter developer account.
The tweet was about Bitcoin.</description>

      <description>This project only for fun and education not financial advice.
Nowdays cryptocurrency more popullar thank stocks, forex, and any exchange Cryptocurrency is very volatile assets/price, technical, news, sentiment drive the price.
I just try Machine Learning to predict price of cryptocurrency such as :
 Bitcoin Ethereum (ETH) Cardano (ADA), Binance (BNB) the most popullar and top marketcap.  Datasets cryptocurrency as historical data can find at : https://www.coingecko.com/en
 We can choose any cryptocurrency and download dataset in CSV files.</description>
